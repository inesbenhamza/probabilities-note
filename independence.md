## Independence of Events

Two events are said to be **independent** if knowing the outcome of one event does not change your belief about whether or not the other event will occur.  

For example, you might say that two separate dice rolls are independent of one another: the outcome of the first dice gives you no information about the outcome of the second â€” and vice versa.

The formal definition is:

`P(E | F) = P(E)`

Independence is a property which is often "assumed" if you think it is reasonable that one event is unlikely to influence your belief that the other will occur
